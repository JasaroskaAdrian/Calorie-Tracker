# How to start the Website

First of all you need to install all needed Packages, i know some might judge me but i just do "npm install" to install every possible package, Packages has always been a hassle for me.

Then after the node_modules are installed (Not in the src Folder) use "npm run dev" in the Terminal and the Website should Launch.

Thats Everything!
